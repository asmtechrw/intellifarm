# IntelliFarm Tech

## Abstract

IntelliFarm Tech is a precision farming solution designed to revolutionize modern agriculture by leveraging machine learning, Python, and Streamlit. The project aims to provide farmers with real-time, data-driven insights to enhance crop yield, optimize resource utilization, and foster sustainable farming practices.

## Problem Statement

Agricultural communities face challenges such as suboptimal crop yields, diminished returns on investment, and a lack of informed decisions for veteran farmers regarding suitable crops.

## Aim and Objectives

- **Aim:** To empower farmers through data-driven insights and technology.
  
- **Objectives:**
  1. Provide data-driven insights.
  2. Suggest crops, fertilizers, and assess soil quality.
  3. Develop a user-friendly UI for farmers.
  4. Make the platform free of cost for broader accessibility.

## System Design/Architecture

IntelliFarm Tech integrates Python and machine learning at the backend, with Streamlit serving as the GUI.

## System Development Approach (Technology Used)

- **Algorithm:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Scikit Learn
  - Matplotlib
  - NumPy and Pandas

## Analysis and Planning

Identify farmer needs, define scope, allocate resources, and set timelines.

## Data Preparation

Gather agricultural data (weather, soil, crops), clean, preprocess, and organize the data.

## Machine Learning Models

Develop crop, fertilizer, and soil analysis algorithms, train models using historical and real-time data.

## User Interface

Create a farmer-friendly Streamlit dashboard, design an intuitive navigation system.

## Testing and Deployment

Validate model accuracy through testing data, deploy the system on Azure.

## Feedback and Iteration

Continuously gather user input, make iterative improvements for enhanced user experience.

## How to Use
